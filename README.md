# Project 1: 
## Overview
In this project, you will implement a process manager capable of allocating memory to processes
and scheduling them for execution. This project has two phases. In the first phase, a scheduling
algorithm will allocate the CPU to processes, making the assumption that memory requirements
are always satisfied. In the second phase, a memory allocation algorithm will be used to allocate
memory to processes, before the scheduling takes place. Both the memory allocation and the
process scheduling are simulated. There is also a challenge task that requires controlling the
execution of real processes during the process scheduling. Process scheduling decisions will be
based on a scheduling algorithm with the assumption of a single CPU (i.e, only one process can
be running at a time)

# Project 2:
## Overview
Remote Procedure Call (RPC) is a crucial technology in distributed computing that enables software applications
to communicate with each other seamlessly over a network. It provides a way for a client to call a function on a
remote server as if it were a local function call. This abstraction allows developers to build distributed systems
and applications that span multiple machines and platforms.
In this project, you will be building a custom RPC system that allows computations to be split seamlessly between
multiple computers. This system may differ from standard RPC systems, but the underlying principles of RPC
will still apply.
Your RPC system must be written in C. Submissions that do not compile and run on a Linux cloud VM, like
the one you have been provided with, may receive zero marks. You must write your own RPC code, without
using existing RPC libraries.
